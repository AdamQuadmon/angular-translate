<h3 id="installingdependencies">Installing dependencies</h4>

<p>These tools are used during the development of <code>angular-translate</code>, so you should
consider install them on your machine to make sure things work properly.
Please install the following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://karma-runner.github.com/0.8/index.html">Karma Testrunner</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/twitter/bower">Bower</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installingviabower">Installing via Bower</h4>

<p>You can install a <code>angular-translate</code> package very easy using Bower. After
installing Bower on your machine, simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ bower install angular-translate
</code></pre>

<p>This will install a package in your configured components folder. You can watch the
bower package repository <a href="https://github.com/PascalPrecht/bower-angular-translate">here</a>.
As you can see, it's pretty much broken down to things that matter. The raw source.
For development as well as production use.</p>

<p>You might notice that there's another package. <code>angular-translate-interpolation-default</code>
is a package which contains the default interpolation engine angular-translate uses
to interpolate your translations. We'll come to this later, currently you only
have to know that this package exists and that you have to embed it in your HTML document.</p>

<h3 id="installingwithgit">Installing with Git</h4>

<p>Another way to get the source of angular-translate, is to clone the whole repository
from GitHub.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/PascalPrecht/angular-translate.git
</code></pre>

<p>You now have a full clone of the repository including the history and everything
else ever happened during the development of angular-translate. Do with the code
what ever the fuck you want.</p>

<p>Since angular-translate has some dependencies when developing it, you can just install
all of'em. If you do so, the <code>angular-translate-interpolation-default</code> package is
already included. To install all needed dependencies, simply run the following
command in the cloned angular-translate repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install
$ bower install
</code></pre>

<h3 id="runningprovidedunittests">Running provided unit tests</h4>

<p>Of course, <code>angular-translate</code> comes with a full featured testsuite which just waits
for you to run it. This is where the <strong>Karma testrunner</strong> comes in. Navigate to the
folder you cloned the project in and run:</p>

<pre><code>$ karma start karma.unit.conf
</code></pre>

<p>This will start a testrunner which uses the <strong>Jasmine testing framework</strong> to execute all
provided unit tests. If everything's green, go ahead. Otherwise, fix it and send a pull
request. Thanks.</p>

<p>There are also <strong>midway tests</strong> you can run. To do that, start Karma with the provided
configuration file for midway tests:</p>

<pre><code>$ karma start karma.midway.conf
</code></pre>

<h3 id="buildingfromsource">Building from source</h4>

<p>When all tests passed successfully you can now build a development, as well as
a production version of the code, just like you get from the Bower package.
angular-translate provides a <code>Gruntfile.js</code> files which contains configured
tasks you can run with the <code>grunt</code> command.</p>

<p>To get a build of <code>angular-translate</code> simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ grunt build
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate files ready for development and production use in a created
<code>dist</code> folder. Files should look like <code>dist/angular-translate.js</code> and
<code>dist/angular-translate.min.js</code>.</p>

<p>These two files are ready to use, embed them in your HTML document and you're
ready to rock!</p>
