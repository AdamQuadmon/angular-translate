<div><h1 id="events">Events</h2>

<p>angular-translate triggers some custom events on <code>$rootScope</code> you can react on,
once they are fired. This document describes the different events and when they
get fired.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h3>

<p>Some events get fired independently on how you have configured angular-translate.
These are general events you could always expect to be fired.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslatechangestart"><code>$translateChangeStart</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired anytime angular-translate starts to try to change the language. This is
on startup, when setting the language the first time, or when changing the language
at runtime using <code>$translate.uses()</code>. This event gets also fired when angular-translate
has to load translation data asynchronously first.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslatechangesuccess"><code>$translateChangeSuccess</code></h5>

<p>As the event name says, this gets fired once a translation change was successful.
When not using an asynchronous loader, this event gets usually fired immediatly
after <code>$translateChangeStart</code> event. This event gets also fired, after an
asynchronous loader had to load translation data first.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslatechangeerror"><code>$translateChangeError</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired when a translation change failed. This actually only occurs when an
asynchronous loader rejects a returned promise.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslatechangeend"><code>$translateChangeEnd</code></h5>

<p>Gets always fired when a translation change ends, wether it was successful or
not and after all registered interpolation services have been notified about the
translation change.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronousloading">Asynchronous loading</h3>

<p>There are some events that get only fired when an asynchronous loader is used.
These are covered here.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslateloadingstart"><code>$translateLoadingStart</code></h5>

<p>Just as the event name says, this event gets fired when a registered asynchronous
loader gets invoked, right after <code>$translateChangeStart</code> has been fired.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslateloadingsuccess"><code>$translateLoadingSuccess</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired when the asynchronous loader returns with a resolved promise.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslateloadingerror"><code>$translateLoadingError</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired when the asynchronous loader returns with rejected promise.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslateloadingend"><code>$translateLoadingEnd</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired wether an asynchronous loader returned with a resolved or rejected
promise. In the case a loader returned with a resolved promise, this gets fired
after the translation table has been updated.</p>

<h4 id="dtranslatepartialloaderstructurechanged"><code>$translatePartialLoaderStructureChanged</code></h5>

<p>Gets fired when changing the "structure" of <code>$translatePartialLoader</code> using
any kind of <code>*Part()</code> method.</p></div>
